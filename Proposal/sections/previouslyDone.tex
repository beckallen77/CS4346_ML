\section{Existing Research}

There are many existing projects on estimating housing values based on parameters like the number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, the square footage, etc. We believe that these projects will be beneficial as a starting point for our project in understanding machine learning better, yet we plan to take this idea farther by understanding the relation of ZIP Codes and the different parameters that can be addressed when ZIP Codes are taken into consideration. In one article researched ~\cite{Bershadskiy}, the author describes how he went through the process of using a regression algorithm for his houses where his parameters described the characteristics of a home. This article only took into account the specifics of the home, while we plan to branch farther into community factors that will effect a homes value. "Hedonic" factors are included another article ~\cite{Bergadano2019}, these features point out the features of a home, as parameters, that would bring the most satisfaction to the consumer, yet still doesn't appropriately apply all the outside factors from the community that may be involved in the home appraisal. The last article that we analyzed for background information ~\cite{Christian2019} where the author tried to generate values close to the X-Value seen in the Singapore Real Estate Exchange(SRX). In this machine learning property valuation, the author used many housing characteristic features, yet did not include the extent of parameters outside of a home that we are looking to analyze.
