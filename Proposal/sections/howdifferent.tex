\section{Differences in Proposed Work}

Our Proposed research aims at taking in many more factors that influence a houses value aside from the physical aspects of the house itself. We will be working with the main features of house, including all the amenities that a house can have, yet look to aim at a broader image of the local factors that can effect a houses value. These factors would include parameters like how big the population of the ZIP Code is in relation to how many acres are in that ZIP Code, the number of schools within the ZIP Code, average revenue for businesses within that ZIP Code, the government, average income per ZIP Code, and any other parameters that we have access to and deem important.
